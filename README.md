  🦔 Hi. Welcome. It's breezy in here. 🍂
  <br />
  <br />
  I am consistent.
  I am curious.
  <br />
  <br />
 Looking for like-minded people to work together.
  <br />
  <br />
 Every little step counts. Look back and we'll realize how much we've accomplished. :)
  <br />
  <br />
  Fun fact about me:
  <br />
  I have been singing in choir for more than 3 years as a Soprano & Alto. 
  <br />
  <br />
  😆 Choirs I've been proudly in:
